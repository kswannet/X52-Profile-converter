# X52-Profile-converter
Tool to convert X52Pro profiles to be used with the X52 NON-Pro

Simply use run the .exe/.py file, use the file browser to select a .pr0 profile file made for the X52 Pro flightstick and click convert.
The new .pr0 file compatible with the non-pro X52 will be created in the same directory with the "_converted_ suffix.

Note that the .pr0 filename should not contain letters, e.g. "DCS_F15C.pr0", as this will cause driver issues making the stick disconnect and re-calibrate mid-use.
To avoid problems just make sure to remove any numbers from the filename, so e.g. "DCS_Fftn.pr0.
